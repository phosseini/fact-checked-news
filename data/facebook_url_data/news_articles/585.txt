Nude Beach coming to Marshall County on Lake Texoma

Marshall County, OK, A DECISION on whether Cumberland cove resort to be turned into a nudist beach will be made at Marshall County’s Council meeting next week. The motion has been put forward by residents and land owners in the area.

It is in response to an increasing number of reports about the lack of funding and interest in the resort has had in many years in the area. In most recent years the area of Cumberland Cover has been defunct from silt in from the Washita Arm of Lake Texoma. For several years the Corp of Engineers have been asked to perform maintenance on this area, but none have been done. Local residents who have had land taken to construct Lake Texoma are upset that at first they were told how great the Lake was going to be then so many years later it’s just one flood after another, silted in resorts that can’t get a boat in or out. “It’s typical Government neglect”, one local resident stated.

But supporters of the “clothing optional” status say it is “crazy” to consider closing the beach and Cumberland cove area due to lack of interest. By opening a nude beach and updating the store and building new structures will bring many if not hundreds of people to the area and also bring in extra money to Cumberland cove area as well as the County. There will be a “topless” bar and restaurant built as soon as approval of the beach is made next Tuesday in Madill, OK.
Protesters on both sides are planning to turn up at the courthouse in Madill, Ok next Tuesday to protest.

Several post on the local newspaper website as well as their Facebook page are in support of this new business ventures.

“We need a lot of people outside Marshall County Courthouse in Madill, Ok next Tuesday to show their support for the nude beach.
