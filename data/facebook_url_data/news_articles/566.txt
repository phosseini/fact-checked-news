CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee – Reports out of Hollywood this afternoon are confirming that a portion of the next Star Wars movie, Episode IX, will be filmed near Chattanooga, Tennessee. The yet-to-be disclosed location near Chattanooga will represent an unknown, but pivotal, planet in the Star Wars universe.

Details have not yet released as to when production would occur in the Chattanooga area, but they stated it should begin no later than this fall. A casting call for extras will be announced well before then, though. Local fans of the series were understandably excited about the news and particularly excited about the prospect of becoming an extra in the film after producers made this short statement, released to the press earlier today: “We think the greater Chattanooga area is a fantastic place to find the hundreds of extras needed to support our alien civilization and we’re very excited about filming there. It’s countryside is really a beautiful part of the world with diverse land-forms that open up a lot of possibilities for us.”

Fans are also pointing out today that Episode IX will see the return of Director JJ Abrams, who first rebooted the series with 2015’s The Force Awakens. In appreciation of this stellar news, here’s a teaser trailer for this year’s Episode XIII: The Last Jedi.
