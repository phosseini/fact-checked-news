It’s happening! Sharia Law has officially taken over the American town of Dearborn, Michigan.

If Muslims are only in America to be able to freely and openly practice their religion without persecution than why do they want to take over entire cities and force them to live under Sharia law, not the American law? Thanks to Obama Dearborn, Michigan is the first American city to be completely outside of American law because of religious views.

The following video shows that thanks to the policies of Barack Obama, at least one American town is already completely under Sharia Law. And it won’t be the last if we don’t start supporting President Trump’s immigration policies.

Ending immigration isn’t what President Trump is doing. Obviously, America is a cultural melting pot and everyone here is an immigrant in one way or another.

The problem with immigrants is that there are the ones who aren’t coming here to assimilate and become Americans. They are coming here to take over and those are the immigrants that will be caught using extreme vetting.
