President Donald Trump hasn’t even been in office for a full month and Democrats are already looking for ways to have him impeached.

Here’s the scoop...

On Thursday, The Washington Post reported, that Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-New York) filed a “resolution of inquiry” into President Trump. A resolution of inquiry is used to force presidents and other members of the executive branch to share records with Congress.

In Nadler’s resolution, he asks Attorney General Jeff Sessions to, within 14 days, provide Congress with “copies of any document, record, memo, correspondence, or other communication of the Department of Justice” that provides information on investigations of Trump and his associates, his foreign business interests, and potential conflicts of interest, including those that would violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution.

There are a few different ways that the Judiciary Committee can respond to Nadler’s resolution. They have 14 legislative days (Congressional workdays) to debate and vote on whether to report the resolution favorably, reject it, or revise it; if the committee does not take actions within the 14 allotted days, Nadler can request that the resolution be discharged so that the entire House can vote on it.

This is bogus.

Trump has literally done nothing yet for anyone to call for impeachment.

He was well within his right to bar people from coming into this country if he feels they pose a direct threat. It’s that simple.

If only the left would try to stop dividing, maybe tensions will calm.
