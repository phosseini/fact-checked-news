The man and wife from a Chinese village had been having regular sex in their bid for a child, but were having no luck and went to a doctor to find out what was up.

A MARRIED couple who were desperate to conceive were found to have been having anal sex for four years.

The extraordinary blunder came to light after a 26-year-old man and his 24-year-old wife went to see an obstetrician about their lack of success.

When Dr Liu Hongmei investigated further she found out the woman had regular sex but that it was "unusually painful" every time.

At first Dr Lui thought her patient might be suffering some sort of disease or disorder.

But according to China’s Guiyang Evening Post, further examinations found the clueless couple from Bijie city in China’s south-western Guizhou province, had been having anal sex all along.

Further tests confirmed this and amazingly found the wife was a virgin.
