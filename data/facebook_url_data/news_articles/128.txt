Waukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing people in the area in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning.

“We reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the head” explains O’Keef.

“I’D HEARD OF THE LAKE MICHIGAN MONSTER, BUT NEVER DID I EXPECT TO CATCH IT MYSELF,” CLAIMS THE 63-YEAR-OLD CANADIAN TOURIST.

The great white shark estimated at more than 1.2 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts.
