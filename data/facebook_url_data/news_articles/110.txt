Emma Gonzalez is a student at Marjory Douglas Stoneman High School when it was the target of a mass shooting in February 2018 that killed 17 students. Since that shooting, a number of students from the school have become vocal activists for stricter gun control regulation, including Emma Gonzalez.

Gun control has been a controversial topic in the United States for a number of years amidst an increase in mass shooting incidents across the country, and gun control opponents have argued that it is unconstitutional to impose strict regulations relating to guns, specifically violating the second amendment that guarantees citizens in the US the right to bear arms.

As such, gun control opponents have argued that activists like Emma Gonzalez are promoting an unconstitutional agenda, thus the image.

However the image has been digitally altered. In reality the paper that Emma Gonzalez is ripping up is a shooting target. It was a photo shoot for an article in Teen Vogue. The original image can be seen below.

As such the image of Emma Gonzalez ripping up the US Constitution is a hoax.
