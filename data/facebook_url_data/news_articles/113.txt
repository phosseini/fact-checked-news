SAVANNAH, Georgia – During a radio interview this morning, New York comedian Jerry Seinfeld took a moment to praise the residents of Savannah, Georgia who came to his aid after experiencing a mechanical issue with his car before filming an episode of his hit show Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.

“I had just left downtown Savannah and was beginning to enter the outskirts of town when my damn car started overheating or something. I pulled to the side of the road and immediately two or three cars came to help me out. I told them I had a crew van coming to take a look but two men insisted they give me a hand under the hood. After a short two-minute call with my producer one of the guys yelled ‘you’re all set!’ He fixed the damn thing.

I insisted on buying those two guys lunch so we settled on a nearby restaurant – Cotton & Rye – and had a great time. I’m still not sure they even knew who I was, which really made my day.

I’m telling you, these people in Savannah are the salt of the Earth. The real deal. I’m definitely going to move there at some point in the future, honestly.”

Seinfeld later added, “you have to understand, things like this never happen in New York. It’s a completely different culture and one the country could use more of.”
