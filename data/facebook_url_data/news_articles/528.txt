A New York Republican congresswoman said the people behind many mass shootings turn out to be Democrats.

Rep. Claudia Tenney didn't mince words while speaking with on an Albany-area radio show Wednesday.

“Yeah, well, obviously there is a lot of politics in it, and it’s interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats, but the media doesn’t talk about that either,” Tenney told talk show host Fred Dicker.

Tenney didn't offer any evidence for her statement.

During the interview, Tenney also noted that she was worried about what would happen to legal gun owners in the wake of the Florida school shooting that killed 17 people.

“What scares me most is that a lot of these legal gun owners are going to be targeted now,” Tenney said. “In their demographic, they have the least amount of crimes of virtually any other demographic.”

Tenney's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
