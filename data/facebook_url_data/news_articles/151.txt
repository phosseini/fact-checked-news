BARTLESVILLE, Oklahoma – Actress Jennifer Aniston is claiming in a new interview that she is moving to the Bartlesville, Oklahoma area. Aniston said that it wasn’t a permanent move and that her new home in Bartlesville would simply serve as a haven from her public life: “I just want a place to escape to sometimes and the Bartlesville, Oklahoma area seems like a good choice for me. I know it’s going to be a lot different than what I’ve been used to but I’m actually really looking forward to that and I’m just hoping that I can find some peace and serenity there.

I know some people from the Bartlesville area who are helping me pick out a place. We’re looking for something kind of small and away from everything but not too far outside of Bartlesville. I’ve visited the area in the past and just loved the people there. They’re very genuine and they tell you what they actually think. They’re sort of like... regular people, ya know? And from what I’ve seen they’re generally not fake and completely full of themselves,” Aniston said with a laugh.

New rumors are suggesting Aniston may even run for mayor.
