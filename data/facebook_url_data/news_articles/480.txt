A medical breakthrough from Israel can effectively cure cancer, the deadly disease that kills millions of people around the world every year.

A small team of Israeli scientists is claiming to have developed a 100% cancer cure like never before, which they expect to be available for cancer patients by early next year.

The revolutionary cancer cure treatment is called MuTaTo, which is developed by Accelerated Evolution Biotechnologies Ltd. (AEBi).

MuTaTo stands for multi-target-toxin and it reportedly uses a combination of cancer-targeting peptides and a unique toxin that only targets and terminates cancer cells, leaving alone healthy cells and tissue in the process.
The Israeli scientists who developed the cancer treatment drug claim MuTaTo can reduce the side-effects of most cancer treatments, and it can be hyper-personalized to each patient in the long run.

But after successful mice trials, Dr Morad claims they are now fast-tracking MuTaTo to conduct human trials through this year. He’s confident MuTaTo will perform as expected in humans as well — and be a 100% cancer cure that the world has been waiting for.

Dr Morad, who’s CEO of AEBi claims that MuTaTo will prevail where other cancer treatments fail. Prevailing cancer cures don’t work because the cancer cells it attacks mutate and spread to avoid the drug, rendering the treatment useless.

But MuTaTo is different from other cancer cure because it attacks a cancer cell’s receptors from three different directions. “Not even cancer can mutate three receptors at the same time,” claims Dr Morad, in a report.
