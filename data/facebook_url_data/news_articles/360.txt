Obama is a shadow president that will not leave the current administration alone. He has been doing everything he can to mess up what Trump is doing. And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.

Obama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obama’s administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.

The liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administration’s problem, not Trumps.
