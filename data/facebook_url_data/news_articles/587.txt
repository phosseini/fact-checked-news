The number of individuals receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), otherwise known as food stamps, declined by more than two million in fiscal year 2017, according to data released by the Department of Agriculture.

In fiscal year 2016, the number of individuals receiving benefits from the food stamp program totaled 44,219,363. In 2017, that number dropped to 42,182,443â€”a decline of 2,036,920.

Food stamp participation has declined roughly 9 percent over the last four years. In fiscal year 2014, there were 46,663,872 individuals on food stamps.

Historical data show that while the program has expanded greatly over time, participation has declined as of late. The USDA has been tracking data on SNAP participation since fiscal year 1969, at which time average participation in the program stood at about 2,878,000. This means that since then, participation in the program has increased 14-fold.

The data indicate that food stamp participation peaked in year 2013, when there was an average of 47,636,000 individuals benefiting from the program.

As of 2017, the program cost taxpayers about $58 billion with individuals receiving an average benefit of $125.05 per month and households receiving an average benefit of $252.55 per month.

The average benefit per month is $125 per person.

So if you figure 2,000,000 dropped off the food stamp rolls that means the country is saving (2 million x 125 x 12 = 3 billion) $3 billion annually thanks to Trump policies.

That three billion in savings could pay for the Great Trump Border Wall in 6 years!

The massive decrease in food stamp recipients can be explained by more state laws requiring work for benefits and the number of illegal aliens who have dropped from the lists.
