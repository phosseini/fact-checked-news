ROCHESTER, New York – During a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Johnny Depp took a moment to praise Rochester, New York residents who had helped him with a mechanical issue with his rental car as he passed through the city recently:

“We were just leaving the city limits of Rochester, New York when the damn car overheated or something so I pulled it over to the side of the road and within just a minute or two there were a couple of cars that pulled over to help me out. I told them that I was on the phone with the rental car company but one of them had a brother who owned a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and he towed it to a place nearby to get fixed.

So then the one guy finds out that I’m not from there and offers to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, ‘Sure, what the hell.’ So we drove to probably the finest dining spot in Rochester – some place called Sandro’s – and got a sandwich. Great freakin’ burger too. These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly. I’m telling you, these people in Rochester are the real deal. I’m going to move there after I retire,” Depp said with a laugh.

Depp added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would’ve never happened in L.A.! So yeah, that’s my story about Rochester, New York. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in America.”
