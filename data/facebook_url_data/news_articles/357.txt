You know the old saying "If something seems too good to be true...it is?" Well, that's certainly the case if you come across cash on your windshield.

In fact, you might find your luck going from good to bad instantly if you fall for this scam spreading across the US.

Take a look at the signs so you’ll be prepared if you get targeted.

Kyri Vieham had a close call she is using to share with the world to let the public to be on the lookout for this dangerous, and potentially violent, scam.

She had finished shopping and tossed her bags in her car. She was driving on the highway when she realized that someone had put a $100 bill under her windshield wiper.

Excited at her luck, she pulled over and removed the bill.

When she pulled out the bill, there was a note on the back that read “haha, you thought this was real, didn’t you?”

What seems like an odd prank was actually something far more sinister.

Kyri got home and researched what this could mean online.

She learned that when some drivers see the cash before they drive away, they hop out of the car with the engine running. A carjacker parked next to them pops out, jumps in the car, then drives off.
