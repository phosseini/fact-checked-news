ALBANY â€” The window of the Albany County Democratic Committee's headquarters on Colvin Avenue was riddled with gunfire overnight.

The damage, including a half-dozen rounds fired through the window, was discovered Wednesday morning. Committee Chairman Jack Flynn said the bullets struck the window of his office, where he sometimes works late.

"It's pretty scary, because I could have actually been there," he said. "I'm glad that nobody was hurt."

The party's headquarters is located in a suite of offices facing Colvin Avenue in a building midway between Central and Washington avenues.

"I believe there was was an intent to make a statement," Flynn said, noting some of the shots fired at the window hit the name of the organization "right in the middle."

Just after noon Wednesday, police were going in and out of the building. Former Mayor Jerry Jennings passed the scene at one point and expressed his disappointment at the act.

Officer Steve Smith, a spokesman for Albany police, said police received a call about 11 a.m.

He said the bullet holes and damage inside the office at 10 Colvin Ave. were consistent with a gun, but police did not yet know the caliber.

"What we've learned so far is that at least one hole may have been there as early as last week," Smith told reporters. At least nine more of the holes appeared to come from bullets fired between the time employees left the building last night and arrived Wednesday morning, Smith said.

"It's concerning anytime anybody attempts to fire a gun in our city," Smith said. "Thankfully this was after hours. Nobody was in that office."

Police were canvassing the area, which includes street cameras. Smith asked anyone with information to contact police.

Paul Knox, who owns an insurance business next door to the Democratic headquarters, said the shooting was "a bit unsettling" and that the neighborhood is safe.
