Maria Hernandes, of Indianapolis, gave birth on Wednesday after undergoing only two hours of labor and a miraculous vaginal birth. She also carried the 11 babies through a 38 weeks gestation period, which is unheard of when you are dealing with a multiple pregnancy.

Hernandez and her husband say they had trouble conceiving so decided to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF), desperate to become parents. Much to their surprise, they got much more than they had hoped for. Six of the 11 boys are said to be identical twins all weighing in between 1 pound – 1.5 pounds. They are currently in stable condition in the neonatal intensive care unit at Riley Children’s Hospital.

Doctors were very surprised, most mainly say they were shocked, to have such a successful delivery without caesarian section. “We could not stop the babies from coming out,” said Dr. William Roberts. “They literally came out one after another. From the time the first baby came out, and the 11th baby was born, it was only 17 minutes.”

The hospital staff says they have contacted Guinness Book of World Records to supply them with this information to have Maria Hernandes and her family registered in the 2015 edition.
