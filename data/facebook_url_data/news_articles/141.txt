Twenty-second Circuit Court of Appeals Justice, Hansam Al Alallawalahi-Smith has made major headlines this week when he overturned a ruling out of Dearborn, Michigan and tried to implement Sharia Law. The ruling allowed two critical and violent tenets of Sharia Law to be practiced in the United States of America.

When he was asked why the feds have the right to allow a man to brutalize his wife for speaking with another man and to beat her nearly to death if she were to act on her impulses, the judge mentioned the systematic infusion clause and said that the Sharia Law should be allowed because the 14th Amendment guarantees them the rights guaranteed by the other states. The laws may be acceptable to savages, but here, in America, we have higher standards.

Alallaha-Smith stated that the 14th Amendment does not necessarily exclude foreign influence from being allowed by law, citing the Christmas Holiday as a perfect example:

“Christmas is a Christian holiday exclusively, yet, if you are a Muslim and you want to go about your day without being bothered you cannot because the laws of a city in a city in Rome take precedent over the First Amendment which guarantees no state-sponsored religion. A federal Christmas holiday is just that,” said Alallaha-Smith.

With that as a precedent, understanding that a higher court may reverse it, my decision is that items one and two on the docket are allowable between family members as prescribed by Sharia Law,” continued Alallaha-Smith.

The Democrats simply cannot stop complaining about this, claiming that since the appointment wasn’t Trump’s, he can’t use the precedent to fire him. Trump has responded that people always want him to think about the Office in these kinds of situations. His only statement was: “The Office had no choice but to let him go for the good of the country!”
