Donald Trump keeps his promises and now he announced something huge, something that will make millions of Americans cheering.The Social Security program became a real difficulty for our previous administration. Barack Obama and his socialist communist ideology was so FAKE that destroyed  the lives of thousands of American families. 

Barack Obama was 'building up' the welfare policy instead of giving JOBS. He thought that it will be great if he gives low-income families stamps.

On the other hand instead of getting corporations to stay in the USA and open more jobs for Americans. Barack Obama made it possible for them to open gigantic factories oversees, in the third world countries.

Donald Trump promised that the globalist policy will remain history. This is what our President vowed a couple of times during the election campaign: "As President,Ill secure and strengthen Medicare and Social Security. We'll do this with strong economic growth - by bringing our jobs back from Mexico and China, by establishing new jobs and stopping U.S. corporations from fleeing from our country.  American citizens won't loose there programs under Trump."

Now, everything changes. Donald Trump has some great news for all of the social security recipients.

Donald Trump announced that monthly payment is rising to $1,360 for single recipients and  $2,260 for married couples. Also, nobody will be penalized this year and all of the social security recipients will receive their fair share.

This is great! If you're able to realize what is actually happening in our economy, you know that we can recover our middle class, our consumers, and all help the social security recipients and the low-income families get stronger and have an opportunity to get rich.
