In a recent investigation, inspectors discovered a shocking meat into one of the freezers of an Oklahoma City McDonald’s meat factory. It contained human and horse meat! Believe it or not, the human meat was also found in several trucks that were heading to deliver the patties to the restaurants.

Authorities managed to inspect factories and restaurants across the whole country. Their discovery included human meat found in 90% of the locations, while horse meat was found in 65% of the locations! According to FBI agent Lloyd Harrison who worked on this discovery:

“The worst part is that it’s not only human meat, it’s children’s meat. The body parts were found across the US factories and were deemed too small to be adult body parts. This is truly horrible”.

Unfortunately, cannibalism originates thousands of years ago. There are also several tribes today that still practice it as a cultural cult. There was a case in 2013 when a North Korean man was sentenced to death for killing his children for food. America also had a case with two citizens who supported eating human meat, Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish, but they were proclaimed insane.
