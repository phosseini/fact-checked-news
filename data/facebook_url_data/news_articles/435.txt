BUFFALO, New York – A newly released interview with Bill Murray reveals the actor has decided to move to Buffalo, New York. Murray tells the magazine that he has “become a little tired of the L.A. lifestyle” and wants a big change in life.

“I like L.A. but I think I’m just looking for a big change right now. What I like about Buffalo, New York is primarily the people. I’ve only been there a couple of times but the people are great. They’re genuine for one and… real. They’ll tell you what they think and I honestly find that refreshing,” Murray said, laughing.

“I’m not looking for the perfect place to live. You can find perfection in all kinds of wealthy L.A. neighborhoods – or so-called perfection – but that’s not what I want at this point in my life. I want to live in a place that has its own set of problems but people are decent and generally good and they care about their community and that’s about all you can ask for, right? I think I’m going to like it in Buffalo. It’ll be a refreshing change, for sure.”

Murray continued, “This isn’t some kind of retirement announcement. So don’t start writing that. I’m just looking for a change in life and I think I’ve found that in Buffalo.”
