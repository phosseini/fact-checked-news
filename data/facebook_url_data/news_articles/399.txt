A Purple Heart medal recipient and disabled military veteran has taken to GoFundMe to raise money to fund President Donald Trump's border wall.

Brian Kolfage is a triple amputee Air Force veteran who lost both legs and his right hand while serving in Iraq in 2004. Kolfage, a vocal Trump supporter, has also been vocal in fighting against Facebook, which he says blacklisted his page earlier in the year.

He is also the founder of the website Fight4FreeSpeech where he is calling for 1 million signatures in a petition against Facebook, Twitter, and Google.

Now, Kolfage is trying to fund Trump's border wall by raising at least $1 billion. In the description, Kolfage says he hopes by funding a portion of the wall, it "will jumpstart things and will be less money Trump has to secure from our politicians."

Kolfage says he is working to have the $1 billion GoFundMe limit raised in hopes of reaching $2 billion.

In four days, the account has raised over $4 million of his goal.
