A pedophile has been left with “life-altering” injuries after climbing through the bedroom window of two young children, only to be greeted by their pet bulldog who bit his penis off.

52-year-old Randle James of Saline County, Arkansas, climbed into the 1st-floor window of the small family home into the room where the two young sisters were sleeping after passing by and seeing the open window.

After climbing into the room of the 3 and 6-year-old sisters, James got more than he bargained for when family’s Pitt Pull Terrier leaped to the girl’s defense.The dog severed the rapist’s genitals clean off and swallowed his penis and testicles.

The commotion alerted the children’s parents who called emergency services.According to the father of the children, after calling the police, the attacker was in so much pain that he didn’t attempt to make an escape.

James was rushed to the hospital where doctors treated his wounds but said they were unable to rescue his genitalia after it had been swallowed by the pet bulldog.

Hospital staff said they were able to “patch him up,” and while he lost a lot of blood and was clearly in a lot of pain, he would survive.

They added that although his injuries were no-longer life-threatening, they were “certainly life-altering.

“The family, who can’t be named, said they are just thankful their dog was there to protect the young girls from the attacker.The mother of the girls said: “He’s our hero. He’ll be eating steak for a week now.”
