Following the incessant rape of children and elderly women in the country, Indiaâ€™s Cabinet has approved the introduction of the death penalty for child rapists, amid uproar over a series of high-profile cases.

There have been nationwide protests in recent weeks over the gang rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl.

The government has come under fire for not doing enough to prevent sexual-assault cases, many involving children.

A number of serious crimes in India carry the death penalty, but raping a child was not among them until now.

The situation is even worse in South Africa, the statistics of rape has assumed an all time alarming rate, with rapist spreading diseases and infection to their vulnerable victims.

Since South Africa is also experiencing a similar deadly act of rape by some heartless individuals,  some advocates have proceeded to pass a piece of legislation which  would be of good interest of all concerned.
