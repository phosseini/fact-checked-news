“These shows that all appeared during the Obama administration will be banned from TV, can’t have the rest of the world looking at America like we’re a bunch a F*gs”

Said Donald Trump during an interview on Fox News about his plans to ban all tv shows that promote gayness. He will start with the Gayest show ever put on network television Empire.

Trump rolled out a 2 year plan to remove all shows that have too much gay activity and will imposed stiff penalties including hefty fines for any cable network that breaks the rules.

He wants all the gay shows replaced with positive straight tv that lets the rest of the world know what America being great is all about.
