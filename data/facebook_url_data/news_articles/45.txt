Antoinette DeBasile, a Dominican Sister of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary, is offering what she believes to be her most valuable asset to help raise funds to rebuild the Notre-Dame cathedral of Paris.

Sr. DeBasile who entered the Dominican monastery at the age of 16, says she is ready to do anything in her power to help with the reconstruction of the sacred building considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture standing today.

“I have preserved myself all my life for my God and he has asked me to undergo the greatest sacrifice yet to help in the rebuilding of this divine monument,” she wrote in a letter addressed to the media.

“I’ve received an incredibly generous offer in the seven numbers from a rich man in Saudi Arabia who wants to stay anonymous but I’m not too fond of Muslim people in general, so I might wait for someone who shares my Catholic faith and believes in the real God, » she admitted to reporters.

Sr. DeBasile also confessed that she was anxious and apprehended putting her plan into action but that she felt she was pursuing God’s will.

“I won’t lie about the fact that I am a bit curious about the whole process,” she told reporters laughingly. “I’ve never seen a man’s penis in real life, only on the internet,” she added with humor.

Nearly 1 billion has already poured in from ordinary worshippers and high-powered magnates around the world to restore the fire-ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris after the French president set a controversial five-year deadline to get the work done.
