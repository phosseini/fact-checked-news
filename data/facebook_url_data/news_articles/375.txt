As it was announced few minutes ago the famous singer of Black Sabbath, Ozzy Osbourne lost the battle against pneumonia.

His wife Sharon Osbourne wrote on her twitter account:

My best friend and the guy I was in love with. Oh god, I miss him.

I don’t think I’ll ever get over this awful, awful pain. I don’t know if I’ll ever breathe or think normally again. I don’t know how to survive anymore. I need help.

His real name is John Michael Osbourne. He was a working-class child and had five siblings. At the age of 16 he started working in a slaughterhouse. After a year he stopped working and started burglaries and petty bribes to make money to buy drugs.

At 17 he ended up serving a six-month sentence in jail. Out of prison he decided to become a singer and entered his first band Approach. After the breakdown of the Music Machine, Osbourne created another band, Rare Breed with his friend bassist Terence Butler, known. Tony Iommi and his friend drummer Bill Ward belonged to the band Mythology. Through an advertisement that Osbourne put in a newspaper and Butler’s acquaintance with Iommi and Ward, the four young men from Birmingham met in his apartment. They played for the Mythology audience named Earth.

As Earth opened performances of other bands until one day they decided to make their own concert and the crowd appeared waiting to hear a homonymous dance band and so they decided to change their name to Black Sabbath from their favorite horror movie when Ozzy thought that since people pay to scare off a movie you might want to scare off a music band.
