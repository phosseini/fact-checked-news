A 43-year old man from Killeen, Texas is tonight in intensive care after he was seriously injured during what has been described by investigators as a ‘two-week binge on bath salts’ caused him to cut off his own genitals.

The victim – who has not been named – was found by neighbors ‘writhing on the ground in pain’ outside his property. Paramedics were soon on the scene and the 43-year old was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he remains in a critical condition as a result of severe blood loss.

Investigators, unable to interview the victim due to his injuries, turned their attention to a 24-year old woman who had been living at his property and is believed to be his girlfriend. According to the woman’s account, the pair had spent the past couple of weeks leading up to the accident “snorting bath salts” at the man’s residence.

The woman stated that on the day of the incident, her partner began to ‘act really weird’. She said he became violent and threatened her with a knife, before running into the yard. “I had no idea that he would cut off his privates,” she said.

“Remarkably, he seemed quite calm as he began cutting,” she said. “I was the one screaming and begging him to stop.” However, her pleas fell on deaf ears, and the man finished his gory task. “As soon as he finished cutting he ran back inside into the kitchen,” she said.

It was then that the man, still under the influence of the drug, placed his severed genitals inside the microwave and set the timer to five minutes. Paramedics say that the genitals were too damaged from the microwave to have any hope of being reattached.
