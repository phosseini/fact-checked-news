Unless proven with court documents, at the time of Kamalaâ€™s birth, her parents were not U.S. citizens. They were foreign students. At the time of her birth, she was the daughter of non-citizens. This makes her an anchor baby. She is not eligible to hold the office of president.

Where are her papers to prove CITIZENSHIP. And this time citizens are not going to let corrupt JOHN ROBERTS pull a fast one and claim that she is eligible for the presidency like he did with Indonesian Barry Soetoro. Demand that Kamala show documentary evidence of her citizenship and those of her parents.
