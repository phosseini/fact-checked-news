Throughout Donald Trump’s Stormy Daniels and Russia fiascos, it seems as though the only thing standing between the president and Special Counsel Robert Mueller was Trump’s longtime personal attorney,Michael Cohen.

And during all Trump’s presidency, Cohen has vowed to defend the president at all costs, and even put himself on the line for his client. Unfortunately for our corrupt POTUS, Cohen has had a change of heart — and it was just announced on national television. Let’s just say that Trump’s having one BAD Monday!

ABC News reported that Michael Cohen had spoken with George Stephanopoulos for his first interview since his offices were raided by the FBI in April, and he “strongly signaled his willingness to cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller.” Cohen said:

“My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will. I put family and country first.”

Those words coming from the mouth of Trump’s “fix it” lawyer are the last thing the president wants to hear. Stephanopoulos reported that Cohen is “breaking free” and likely to flip on Trump. Stephanopoulos said:

But when I pointed out to Cohen that he wasn’t repeating past vows to “take a bullet” and “do anything” to protect the president, the longtime Trump loyalist left little doubt about where he stands now, saying simply: “To be crystal clear, my wife, my daughter and my son, and this country have my first loyalty.”

Cohen stated that he would turn to his lawyer for guidance and was aggressive in his response when Stephanopoulos asked what he’d do if Trump’s legal team goes after him: “I will not be a punching bag as part of anyone’s defense strategy. I am not a villain of this story, and I will not allow others to try to depict me that way.”

It gets even worse. Cohen blasted Trump for going after the investigators as he defended them:

“I respect the prosecutors. I respect the process. I would not do or say anything that might be perceived as interfering with their professional review of the evidence and the facts.”

“I don’t agree with those who demonize or vilify the FBI. I respect the FBI as an institution, as well as their agents. When they searched my hotel room and my home, it was obviously upsetting to me and my family. Nonetheless, the agents were respectful, courteous and professional. I thanked them for their service and as they left, we shook hands.”

Cohen even defended Mueller: “I don’t like the term witch hunt.”

When Cohen was asked about what result he’d like out of the whole thing, the attorney said: “I want to regain my name and my reputation and my life back.”

Looks like Cohen is prepared to throw Trump under the bus in order to do that. You can watch the interview below:

Oh, boy. #MichaelCohen is cooperating with Mueller. No doubt about it now.
