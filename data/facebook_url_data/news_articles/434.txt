ARCATA, California – Hollywood actor Jim Carrey has revealed in a new interview that he is moving to Arcata, California. In the newly released interview, Carrey said:

“I know it sounds kind of crazy but it’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a long time. I’ve visited Arcata, California a few times over the years and the people there have always seemed like the most genuine and sincere people I think I’ve ever met and most of them had no idea who I was which is kind of a great thing sometimes, to be honest. No place is perfect but Arcata just feels like home to me and I’m looking forward to small town life.

I want to be able to walk into a restaurant and know half the people there. I want to do all of my shopping at one place, like at Walmart. Maybe I’ll get some land and raise a few goats or chickens. I might even run for mayor,” Carrey said, laughing.

Real estate brokers in the area were understandably excited about the news that the wealthy Hollywood actor was moving to their area and some unconfirmed reports are claiming that he already has a home picked out.
