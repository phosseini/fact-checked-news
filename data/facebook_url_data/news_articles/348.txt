Willie Nelson has been struggling to breathe lately, and he has canceled yet another two shows, this time in Las Vegas. According to sources, the 83-year-old smoker has been ravaged by emphysema and pneumonia. His friends are extremely worried.

“Willie’s been so frail and gaunt... a pale shadow of the man he used to be,” a friend says. “He’s never fully recovered from the last time when he was deathly ill, more than a year ago. It’s now come back to hit him like a ton of bricks. If he can’t get a deep breath in and his voice is a croak — there’s no way he can sing.”

The country music legend’s reps ­apologized for his canceled shows on his Facebook page, sending regrets for axing performances “due to recent illness” and announcing the shows “will not be rescheduled.”

Willie also cancelled concerts in 2015 to undergo a stem cell treatment, saying: “It’s supposed to help the lungs. Over the years I’ve smoked a lot of cigarettes, and I’ve had emphysema and pneumonia four or five times, so my lungs were really screwed up.”

According to friends, he has been subsisting  “on potato chips, pretzels and popcorn,” says the source.

He is fighting to stay alive. “But he knows one of these days those reports going to be right,” adds the source. “He’s at death’s door and has got to know it.

Please pray for Willie!
