A 38-year old Smithfield North Carolina butcher has been charged with the brutal killing of his wife, a 32-year old woman, after he allegedly used a meat grinder to dispose of her remains – and then feed it to their cat.

The woman’s family raised the alarm after growing suspicious when she failed to respond to any of their calls or messages. Investigators called on the couple’s residence and noted a large quantity of “strong-smelling meat” in a food bowl for the cat.

“The investigators were suspicious and took a sample of the meat,” said one source. “They also interviewed the husband who claimed his wife had left without any notice to visit relatives in another state for Christmas. However, they found her phone and purse in the main bedroom which suggests she met with foul play”

Investigators raided the butcher shop where the husband works and confiscated a large meat grinder. “It will be alleged that the man killed his wife after learning that she was having an affair. He then used the meat grinder to dispose of her remains, and we found traces of DNA in the meat that was in the cat’s food bowl.”

The husband has been held in custody pending a bail hearing, which is unlikely to be granted given the circumstances of the case. “In my 30 year career on the force this is one of the most sickening, depraved acts I have encountered,” said one investigator.
