Caitlyn Jenner is pissed that all of her kids wished her a happy Father’s day but didn’t acknowledge her this year on Mother’s day. Kylie Jenner even posted on her Instagram account wishing Caitlyn a happy Father’s day but soon deleted the post minutes after it was posted. Caitlyn still appreciates the love she is getting from her family, but wants to be acknowledged as the mother instead of the father.Formerly known as Bruce Jenner, Caitlyn is the mother of 6 children, Burt, Brandon, Cassandra, Brody, Kendall and Kylie and step mother of four, Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and Rob and a host of grandkids. All of which have attempted to give their former father a special day but Caitlyn isn’t here for it.

“I love my children but they have to acknowledge me for who I truly am. I am their mother and always have been regardless of what form of genitalia I currently have. This transition is still an ongoing process and I hope that my children will show a little more consideration towards my feelings.”
