While much of Hollywood has spent its political capital in the weeks since the election lambasting President-elect Donald Trump and fawning over outgoing President Barack Obama, actress Nicole Kidman has taken a different — and certainly unexpected — tack.

During an interview this week with BBC News, the “Lion” star, who noted that she tries to steer clear of making political statements, said it’s just time to move on and get on board.

“I just say he’s now elected,” Kidman, an Australian native with dual citizenship in the U.S., told BBC. “We as a country need to support whosever the president, because that’s what the country’s based on. And however that happened, he’s there and let’s go.”

Instead of weighing in on a particular candidate, like her Tinseltown neighbors are prone to do, the Academy Award winner said she cares much more about specific issues, not particular people.

“I’m always reticent to start commenting politically. I’ve never done it in terms of America or Australia. I’m issue-based,” Kidman said. “[F]or me, I’m very committed to women’s issues.”

Kidman is also a goodwill ambassador for United Nations Women. “I do a lot of fundraising for U.N. Women, and I do a lot of traveling for them,” she told the news outlet.

“I also do an enormous amount of fundraising for breast and ovarian cancer, because that’s something that’s affected my family deeply,” she continued. “So they’re my issues that I’m very attached to.”

As for Australian politics, her home country has been embroiled in a battle over legalizing gay marriage. During the sit-down with BBC, Kidman said she supports the legalization of gay marriage in her home country, telling the reporter, “I believe in allowing people who love each other to share their lives together.”

“I really believe that we should stay out of people’s business with that,” she added. “I love when people love each other.”
