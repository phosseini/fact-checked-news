Hollywood’s creme just got to be at another event they created themselves so they could have one more excuse to bully the rest of America with their holy truthfulness and unmistakable life narrative. Naturally, they as they are turned to bully the average American for ever considering picking Donald Trump. However, there are exceptions such as the great actor Denzel Washington who took upon himself to slap his fellow show business people with the unaltered truth.

Show business people such as Meryl Streep and Jimmy Fallon tend to look at themselves as the highest point of the societal hierarchy. However Washington implied they’re dead mistaken. It’s the everyday Americans who work around the clock to make America what it is.

Those are the same everyday Americans who chose to vote for Donald Trump because they had enough of the elitist stigma dominating America or people such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Meryl Streep, and many more.

He then urged them to seize the whole elitist aura and realize that they are not the ultimate truth in the world we live in.

“...people say: ‘Oh, the difficulty of making a movie.’ I’m like, listen, send your son to Iraq–that’s difficult. It’s just a movie. It’s like, relax. I don’t play that precious nonsense.”

Instead of them being utterly obnoxious in the persistence to lead and tell the rest of American what to do, feel and say, Washington told colleagues actors need to be beyond thankful for those same Americans making the able to be where they are.

“Making a movie is a luxury,” he insisted on the truth. “It’s an opportunity, and most importantly, it’s a gift. Obviously, everybody here is talented enough to do that, but don’t get it twisted. It’s just a movie. It ain’t that big a deal.”

We can not believe, but are eternally grateful that such a person emerged to tell the raw, without makeup truth in Hollywood.
