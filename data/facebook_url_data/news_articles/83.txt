A Canton, Ohio man is being hospitalized after his brand new Apple AirPod earphones allegedly exploded in his ear.

Paul Johnson, 21, is being hospitalized with 2nd degree burns on his face after his Airpods exploded. According to Paul, who admitted to have been watching pornography when his Airpods exploded, also has 1st degree burns on his penis and testicles. “I ain’t buy my 3 year old son any presents this year because I bought the airpods instead, and now this, couldn’t even get my nut on” said Paul as he was laying in his hospital bed.

Paul also later admitted to almost always having his Airpods in his ear, other than the times where he was charging them. He would even sleep with them, and wear them even when not listening to music. “Airpod owners are obsessed” says Candice James, a therapist, “Airpod owners feel like Thanos, it’s ridiculous”.

As Paul is recovering, Technology experts warn Airpod owners to not use them much, as a matter of fact, they advise owners to just throw them out. “Just throw them out”, said tech expert Lee Xiu, “You’ll be a better person, Airpod owners are annoying”.
