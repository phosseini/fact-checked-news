After a federal court quashed the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, a furious Prime Minister Justin Trudeau threatened to increase reconciliation with First Nations.

“If you thought we were reconciling hard with our Indigenous Peoples before this, you are sorely mistaken,” Trudeau told reporters.

“Mark my words, we will rain fiery reconciliation upon Indigenous communities until this pipeline is built.”

In an emergency cabinet meeting earlier on Thursday, Trudeau had to be restrained by senior party members after he threatened to ‘go down to B.C. to build that pipeline my damn self.’

In a statement, the federal government also blamed ‘crafty, smooth-talking’ First Nations for derailing the multi-billion dollar project.
