Honoring the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks is an admirable cause, but one university says no matter how honorable the intent, such a memorial can’t be done with images of the World Trade Center attacks.

Administrators at Ripon College in Ripon, Wisconsin have ruled that posters created for Young America’s Foundation’s 9/11: Never Forget Project create an “environment” where “students from a Muslim background would feel singled out and/or harassed.”

YAF undertakes its 9/11 memorial project at campuses around the country every year. The posters created for last year’s 9/11 remembrance sparked complaints.

The center image simply contains the phrase “Never Forget.” Among the images surrounding the center square are images of Americans being captured in Iran in 1979, the World Trade Center in flames in 2001, the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens in 2012, American journalist James Foley just minutes before he was beheaded by an ISIS soldier in 2014, the aftermath of the deadly Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in 2016, American reporter Daniel Pearl just before his murder at the hands of Muslim terrorists in 2002, an image of the USS Cole after it was attacked by a suicide bomber in 2000, and images of the U.S. Marine barracks that was bombed in 1983.

There is no direct reference to Muslims in the text of the poster.
