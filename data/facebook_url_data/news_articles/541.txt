MUMBAI: Senior BJP member and Union minister for road and surface transport Nitin Gadkari’s comments on a television show aired recently may cause the ruling party much embarrassment, giving ammunition to the opposition to target it for having made “tall promises”.

“We were very confident that we would never come to power, so we were advised to make tall promises,” said Gadkari during the show. “Now that we are in power, the public reminds us of those promises made by us. However, these days, we just laugh and move on.”

The interview was aired on a Marathi channel a few days ago.

Gadkari appears to say on the show that BJP won the polls on the basis of unrealistic promises. Congress was quick to respond, sharing the video clip on Twitter and saying that Gadkari had proved that the BJP government was “built on jumlaas and fake promises”.

All India Congress Committee president Rahul Gandhi also tweeted the video, stating: “You are right. Even the people now started thinking that the government used their aspirations and faith for satisfying party’s needs.”
