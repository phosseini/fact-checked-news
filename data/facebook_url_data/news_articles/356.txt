Two of the young women found buried in steel barrels in Bill Clinton’s yard may not be so easy to pin on the serial killer who used to live next door. Muriel Benson and Rita Kimbrowicz, who are estimated to have been 20 and 21 when they died, went to the same high school as Bill Clinton in what would be one of the most eerily odd coincidences of all time.

Lead investigator F. Watts Meyer of the Department of Justice says the chances of those 2 girls finding their way into a guy they went to high school with’s back yard dead 50 years later and 1500 miles away are nothing short of impossible. Investigators are looking for more personal ties now, but they are certain that William Clinton attended Milford High School during three shared years with these two women. They were both a year younger than he was.

Until they manage to come up with something a little bit more firm, the FBI has decided not to charge Clinton or haul him in for questioning. US Attorney Darla Grey says she has high hopes of having enough evidence for a grand jury indictment, which would solidify the charges and make the motions to dismiss process go faster.

Clinton has still made no attempts to explain or even address the bodies in his yard, but his spokesman thinks “anyone who believes this nonsense will end with Bill Clinton in jail is an idiot.”

Time will tell.
