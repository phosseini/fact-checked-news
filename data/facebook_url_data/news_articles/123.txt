According to the President, the average monthly payment will be boosted for $1,360 for single recipients, and the payment for married couples will be increased by $2,260.

Washington is full of good news, and the best is yet to come. Well, that’s why we elected Donald Trump for President, right? It seems like Washington will offer a lot more than this. It’s time to help Social security recipients who need a job. These people will finally enjoy better opportunities.

As confirmed by several sources, Americans who need a job will now have an opportunity to earn a lot more than before, and of course, that won’t affect their benefits.

People under 65 can earn up to $16,920 in 2017. Americans older than 66 can earn up to $44,880. That’s a $3,000 jump from 2016. That’s what we’re talking about the whole time. These people never experienced high benefits, and they ended paying tall penalties. Now Americans will be able to earn without being forced to pay if they earn too much. The penalties will drop in 2017, and that’s a new twist in the story of every American.

Americans under 65 will give $1 for every $2 that goes above the maximum earnings. Those who are older than 66, but haven’t retired yet, will give $1 for every $3 they earn over the limit. After the retiring, the limits are off. Americans will also receive their money back.

That’s awesome, right?

What do you think about the new increase in monthly payments? Do you think the President did a good job? Are you happy with the way things are handled?
