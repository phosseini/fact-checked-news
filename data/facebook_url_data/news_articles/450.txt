In a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Will Ferrell took a few moments to praise Williamsport, Pennsylvania residents for helping him after his rental car encountered a mechanical issue as he was passing through the city recently:

“We were just leaving Williamsport, Pennsylvania when our car began to overheat so I pulled over to the side of the road and noticed there were a couple of cars pulling up behind me. They got out and asked if I needed any help and I told them that I was just about to call someone. Then one of them says that he has a brother who owns a tow truck and a few minutes later it showed up and they towed it in to get fixed.

So now we’re talking and I’m telling them that I’m just passing through the area and they offer to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, ‘Sure, what the hell.’ So we drove to what is probably the finest dining spot in all of Williamsport – some place on 4th Street, I think it was – and had one hell of a great sandwich.

And these guys had no idea who I was which, honestly, just made my day. I’m telling you, these people in Williamsport are the real deal. If I ever retire, I’m moving there!” Ferrell said with a laugh.

Ferrell added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would have never happened in L.A.! So yeah… that’s my story about Williamsport, Pennsylvania. It’s nice to know that there are still places like this in America.”
