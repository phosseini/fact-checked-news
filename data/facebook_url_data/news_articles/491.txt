Afake video of the ride “Gyro Drop” from Lotte World South Korea went viral on Thursday and had a lot of people fooled.

The video was doctored with CGI to make the ride look much more terrifying and innovative than it actually is. The video shows an extendable arm that doubles the size of the drop. The seats of the ride then drop down, attached by extendable bungee ropes, and turn into swings as the ride rotates in circles before retracting riders back up and dropping them straight down.

The video was posted all over social media from large influencers who were fooled by the slick CGI. It was posted earlier in the day by @Mewcg and @wonwoobabie and went viral from there.
