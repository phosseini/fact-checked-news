A recent investigation has revealed that the Freddy Kruger character was based on a real serial killer who lived in Carrollton, Ohio in the 1800s.

According to police files of the time, Mr. Kruger had killed at least seven children within Carrollton. He reportedly murdered the children using only a gardening claw, and he lived inside the tile factory where he worked as a maintenance person; having set up a small living area (and torture area) within the "mechanical room" of the facility. Oh...back then, a "mechanical room" was also known as a "boiler room".

Mr. Kruger was eventually caught, tried, and found to be criminally insane. He spent the rest of his life in Kings Park Psychiatric Hospital before dying unexpectedly in his sleep at the age of 72.

To this day (and LONG before the Elm St. films) Kings Park Psych Hospital was said to be haunted by the ghost of Freddy Kruger.
