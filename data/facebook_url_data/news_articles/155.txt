Footage has surfaced of Jay-Z punching an underage girl in the face after she approached him and asked him for his autograph.

The music industry mogul, who recently engaged in a Twitter spat with President Trump, can be seen delivering a straight right jab to the young girl’s face, before following up with flat-handed right, roughly pushing her away from him.

The shocking footage is the just the latest in a long line of scandals surrounding Jay-Z, a known Satanist who promotes the Luciferian ideology of the New World Order.

At age 12, Jay-Z shot his brother in the shoulder for stealing his ring. Speaking about the incident to ABC 7, the world-renowned rapper and producer, who belonged to a gang, said that he thought he would “go to jail forever”.

But he didn’t go to jail, and his antics got worse. He has rapped about selling crack to his mother, but has lately started claiming it was “other mothers.”

Jay-Z also got three years probation for stabbing record executive Lance “Un” Rivera at a party in 1999.

The far left rapper, who has plans to run for president in 2020, hit the headlines after calling President Trump a “superbug” on CNN this week, and then went on to explain how black people don’t care about his economic success because, “It’s not about money at the end of the day.”

Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!
