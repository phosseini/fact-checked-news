Goose Creek, SC | A South Carolina man was miraculously rescued by passers-by after he lost control of his vehicle and ended up in a nearby river.

Anthony Sanders, 47, reportedly told police officers he was attempting to perform oral sex on himself while driving his car when his head apparently got stuck under the steering wheel thus losing control of his vehicle.

The man who is recently divorced and is allegedly suffering from depression was found heavily intoxicated and admitted being under the influence of alcohol, crystal meth and crack cocaine.

“He had his head stuck under the steering wheel with his genitals inside his mouth. I don’t understand how he got into that position,” Adam Simmons, one of his rescuers, told reporters.

Several locals came to the rescue of Anthony Sanders, 47, who apparently crashed his car into the river while attempting to perform oral sex on himself, according to officials.

An uncontrollable urge for sex

Sanders told officers he had an uncontrollable urge for a “blowjob” moments before the accident occurred.

“The driver was heavily intoxicated under several substances and was attempting to perform oral sex on himself while driving, which is by itself a blatantly dangerous maneuver,” explained Deputy Sheriff, Robert Kilsh.

Anthony Sanders was immediately brought to the Trident Medical Center where he was found to suffer from several broken ribs and deep lacerations to the back of his mouth and throat, say doctors.

Anthony Sanders faces accusations of driving under the influence as well as 16 different accounts of reckless driving and could face up to 15 years in jail if found guilty according to South Carolina state laws.
