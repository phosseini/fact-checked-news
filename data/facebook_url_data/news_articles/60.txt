A 24 year old South Sudanese girl by the name Nancy Deng has reportedly given birth to a litter of German shepherd puppies in Perth, Australia after being hospitalized with severe stomach pains. Doctors at Perth private hospital were surprised to see Nancy go into labor as she didn’t know she was pregnant.

One of the doctors at the Medical centre were Nancy gave birth to her puppies said that they were even more shocked to see four tiny puppies coming out instead of a baby. The Doctor said, ”To be honest, we didn’t know this was possible. It’s both a marvel of modern medicine and extremely disturbing at the same time”.

A reliable source told our staff that Nancy confessed to the doctors that she had sex with the neighbor’s dog on numerous occasions. We are told that Nancy is fond of her neighbor’s dog. A couple of South Sudanese in the neighborhood claimed to have spotted Nancy walking the dog many times.

According to the Doctor, Nancy’s birth is the first on record for an inter-species relationship. “This opens up a lot of doors in science and medicine that we thought were closed”, Said the Doctor. The doctor added that the fact that Nancy’s eggs were able to be implanted by canine sperms is pretty gross but at the same time amazing to the world of Science.

Sex with animals is not a crime in Australia and the doctors have advised Nancy’s relatives not to disown her or subject her to harassment of any sort. The source said that Nancy’s mom is way too disappointed and never did she attempt to visit her daughter at the hospital. Quiet understandable though as it is not easy for her to digest such occurrence.

Nancy used to be on Facebook but she deactivated her account for a reason best known to her. We managed to get hold of her cell phone number but unluckily she didn’t pick when we tried calling her. Perhaps she was busy and hopefully she returns our call. As Juba eye team, we wanted to verbally congratulate her on phone rather than in writing.
