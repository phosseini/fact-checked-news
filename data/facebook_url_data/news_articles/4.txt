As the Senate of the Philippines conducted hearing on electoral reforms, many observers wonder why some of the most important issues that has been tackled and presented during the Senate investigation was not aired nor covered by known Media outlets in the country.

In one of his Facebook post, De La Salle University Professor Antonio Contreras shared the same sentiment regarding this issue. 

"Atty. Glenn Chong presented vital information about the flaws and possible fraud in the elections. Yet no single media entity had live coverage of that portion of the hearing,” stated Professor Contreras.

During the senate hearing, former Biliran representative and lawyer Glenn Chong reveals the alleged fraud in the 2016 elections.

Professor Contreras also added, “When a Senate Hearing on an important issue that ended up exposing flaws in our electoral system doesn't get a single network coverage, then it tells you that media has also been compromised. What a shame.”

Meanwhile, through his official Facebook account, Atty. Glenn Chong shared what really happened during the senate hearing earlier.
