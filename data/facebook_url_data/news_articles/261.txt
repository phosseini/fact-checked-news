While it's widely known that knocking back booze racks up a ton of empty calories, a new study has found a link between tequila and weight loss. This is huge news for agave-spirit lovers—and virtually anyone who plans on some more outdoor drinking as the weather heats up.

According to the American Chemical Society, which researched the effects of tequila on blood glucose levels last year, sugars found in the plant that makes tequila can help lower your blood sugar. The sugars that naturally occurs in the agave plant are called agavins—not to be confused with agave syrup—and are non-digestible, so they won't raise your blood sugar.

During the study, researchers found that mice who'd been given a standard diet, and then drank water with agavins added, ended up eating less overall and had lower blood sugar levels than the others who hadn't consumed agavins. What's more, the mice consuming agavins also produced a hormone called GLP-1, which keeps the stomach full longer and produces insulin, leading researchers to believe that agavins could be beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes or struggling with weight-loss issues.

We're not saying you should start shaking up party-size batches of sugary margaritas or palomas, but a round of tequila shots might start sounding more and more enticing now that we know this potential weight-loss link.
