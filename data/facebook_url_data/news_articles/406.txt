SPECIAL HOLIDAYS – Will the Malacañang Palace declare December 26, 2018 and January 2, 2019 as special non-working holidays like what it did on Dec. 26 and Jan. 2 in 2016-2017?

Nowadays, most Filipinos love holidays and extended holiday vacations so they can spend more time with their families and loved ones. The craving for more time with your loved ones usually intensifies every December.

Previously, on December 2016 and January 2017, the craving was satisfied by the Malacañang Palace’s declaration. The Palace declared Dec. 26 and Jan. 2 in 2016-2017 as special non-working days.

The Office of the President approved the Proclamation stating the days after Christmas and New Year as non-working days to give full opportunity to the Filipino people to spend more time with their loved ones.

Lots of Filipinos flew to their hometown to be with their families for the holiday break and returned on December 26, 2016 and January 2, 2017.

Most likely, if in the previous years Dec. 26 and Jan. 2 in 2016-2017 have been declared as special holidays, many are anticipating that the same thing will happen this December and January.

Will the Malacañang Palace do the same declaration making December 26, 2018 and January 2, 2019 as non-working holidays?

The Christmas Day (December 25) this year will fall on a Tuesday and the same thing with the New Year’s Day (January 1). The said dates are among those considered as annual regular holidays.

As of this writing, the Malacañang Palace has yet to release a declaration regarding the additional holidays for December 2018 and January 2019. We’ll keep you posted for further updates or information.
