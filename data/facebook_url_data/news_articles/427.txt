​A Honduran man killed himself in his padded cell last month after being separated from his wife and child when they crossed the US border.

Marco Antonio Muñoz, 39, was driven to take his own life during asylum processing under the Trump administration's new "zero-tolerance" immigration regime, the Washington Post ​reported Saturday citing Border Patrol agents and an incident report filed by sheriff’s deputies.

Muñoz and his family reportedly crossed the Rio Grande in May to Granjeno, Texas. They were separated at a processing station, and Muñoz broke down. He killed himself after being moved from a detention cell to a local jail in Starr County, Texas.

President Donald had lately come under fire for his administration's new policy of aggressively prosecuting illegal immigrants to the United States, even if it means separating parents from their children.

As many as 2,000 children have been separated from their families in the past month alone, ​according to a ​report Friday by The Intercept.

The May announcement by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions was quickly implemented, with much public attention and outcry about the traumatic effects such separation ​could have on children.

The month of May also ​saw the announcement that Honduran immigrants in particular will lose their temporary protected status in January 2020.
