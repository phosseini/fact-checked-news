President Donald Trump signaled frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions for requesting the Inspector General of the Justice Department to investigate possible FISA abuse.

“Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse,” Trump asked, complaining that it would “take forever” and didn’t have the power to prosecute abuses.

“Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy?” Trump asked. “Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!”

Sessions decision was featured on Fox and Friends on Wednesday morning, about an hour before Trump responded.

Trump has been dissatisfied with Sessions as his Attorney General but has resisted firing him. At one point, Sessions submitted a letter of resignation to the president but was urged to stay by former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.

Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!
