If you haven’t heard, Nancy Pelosi is in the hospital after a drunk driving incident that destroyed the lives of a family whose minivan she hit.

The Parker family was coming home from Church Sunday night when out of nowhere Pelosi’s Range Rover smashed into the side of their minivan. The father, Benjamin, escaped with minor injuries but his wife, Mara, was killed in the impact. Their two children were horrifically injured and passed away at Saint Luke’s Memorial Hospital Monday morning. Also injured in the wreck was the family dog, Snuffles.

How did this happen? According to the South Los Angeles Police Department, Pelosi made the decision to drive her vehicle with a blood alcohol level that was four and a half times the legal limit after her driver took ill.

“The rules don’t apply to her, or so she thinks,” Lt. Adam Pennybaker told local news station WQER. A toxicology report also revealed a high amount of cocaine in Pelosi’s system at the time of the crash.

Ben Parker refused to take this lying down. As soon as heard the details of why his family was destroyed, he immediately contacted the law firm of Karson, Carson, Carlson, and Heisenberg about a lawsuit.

Parker is now suing Pelosi, who is still in the hospital and is expected to be charged with multiple counts of vehicular homicide and driving under the influence of a controlled substance, for 18.3 million dollars – a lawsuit his attorney feels confident he will win.

“My client is devastated, but this will be the easiest win in my entire 26-year-old career,” attorney Benjamin Carlson says. “His entire family was wiped out in the blink of an eye, but we’re going to make her pay dearly.”
