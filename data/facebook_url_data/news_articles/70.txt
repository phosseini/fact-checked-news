Hollywood actor Bruce Willis once again expressed his unconditional support for President Donald Trump in a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon, although these days it’s very unusual for him to be supported by any Hollywood star.

When Willis was asked about his opinion on Trump’s presidency so far he said: “I think that he’s doing great. In fact, he just might be the best US President ever.”

Fallon then asked him if he was serious about this statement because it would definitely sound like an exaggeration to many people. Willis responded: “Yeah I’m being serious about this. Trump has always been a winner and to be honest I can’t think of a better man to lead America at this moment.”

Bruce Willis is one the few conservatives in Hollywood who are not afraid to express their support for President Trump. He has always been a fan of Trump and everything that he represents – a successful businessman and a role model for every young American.

Willis added: “Trump has a winning mentality and I believe that every American can identify with that. He is the guy that we need right now and I think that we should all settle our differences and support him.”

However Willis is bothered by the attitude of many American politicians and stars who spend their time criticizing Trump. He said: “Before every election so far there were debates and fighting between candidates. But, once we had a winner everybody just stood behind the elected President. Now we see that the fighting and conflict continue long after the 2016 election. I don’t like that. It doesn’t look good. If you don’t like him go to Canada or something.”
