An Oklahoma woman, Colleen Hufford, was beheaded at Vaughan Foods, her place of employment by a Muslim who had repeatedly been attempting to convert co-workers to Islam, once again suggesting the problems with identifying radical Islam as a “religion of peace.”

Alton Alexander Nolen, the Islamist who killed Hufford on Sept. 25, 2014, had recently been fired from the business. He was shot by an off-duty police officer during the attack on Hufford and another co-worker, but was hospitalized and survived.

According to TheBlaze, the discovery of Nolen’s religious beliefs, his attempts at converting others to Islam, and the manner in which he killed Hufford led authorities to probe more deeply into the man’s background, to investigate whether or not he has ties to any radical groups that could be in the area.

“After conducting interviews with coworkers of Nolen information was obtained that he recently … started trying to convert some of his coworkers to the Muslim religion,” Jeremy Lewis of the Moore Police Department said.

Traci Johnson, the other victim attacked by Nolen, survived. Police believe she also would have been killed if not for the intervention of the off-duty police officer.

This is scary.
