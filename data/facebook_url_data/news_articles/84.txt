Muslims NEVER assimilate! They will NEVER be apart of another country. STOP the invasion before its too late.

VIA DAILYMAIL: A primary school has been slammed for allowing young Muslim pupils to walk out of assembly when the national anthem is played.

Pupils at Cranbourne Carlisle Primary School, south of Melbourne in Victoria, were given the opportunity to leave the hall in order to observe a religious month of mourning.

But the move has prompted a furious response from parents and politicians who criticised the ‘disgusting’ decision, saying all Australians should be ‘proud’ to sing the anthem.

Lorraine McCurdy, who has two grandchildren at the school, told 3AW that she ‘saw red’ when around 30 or 40 pupils got up and left the assembly during Advance Australia Fair.

‘Two children got up and said `welcome to our assembly’ with that a teacher came forward and said all those who feel it’s against their culture may leave the room,’ Ms McCurdy said.

‘With that about 30 or 40 children got up and left the room. I saw red. I felt ‘you don’t walk out on my national anthem’.’
