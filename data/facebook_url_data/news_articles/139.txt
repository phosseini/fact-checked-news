BLUEFIELD, West Virginia – A newly released interview with Miley Cyrus reveals the pop superstar has decided to move to Bluefield, West Virginia. Cyrus tells the magazine that she has “become a little tired of the L.A. lifestyle” and wants a big change in life.

“I like L.A. but I think I’m just looking for a big change right now. What I like about Bluefield, West Virginia is primarily the people. I’ve only been there a couple of times but the people are great. They’re genuine for one and… real. They’ll tell you what they think and I honestly find that refreshing,” Cyrus said, laughing.

“I’m not looking for the perfect place to live. You can find perfection in all kinds of wealthy L.A. neighborhoods – or so-called perfection – but that’s not what I want at this point in my life. I want to live in a place that has its own set of problems but people are decent and generally good and they care about their community and that’s about all you can ask for, right? I think I’m going to like it in Bluefield. It’ll be a refreshing change, for sure.”

Cyrus continued, “This isn’t some kind of retirement announcement. So don’t start writing that. I’m just looking for a change in life and I think I’ve found that in Bluefield.”
