A Tesla Model 3 is touted as a zero-emissions car by government regulators, but it actually results in more carbon dioxide than a comparable diesel-powered car, according to a recent study. When the CO2 emissions from battery production is included, electric cars, like Teslas, are “in the best case, slightly higher than those of a diesel engine, and are otherwise much higher,” reads a release from the German think tank IFO.

Driving a Tesla Model 3 in Germany, for example, is responsible for 156 to 181 grams of CO2 per kilometer, compared to just 141 grams per kilometer for a diesel-powered Mercedes C220d — that includes emissions from producing diesel fuel.Yeah, this isn’t surprising in the slightest. Pretty much everything on this rock produces carbon in one way or another. Every time you exhale, you’re putting a little more carbon in the atmosphere. Though, you might wanna keep that one from the lefties. If you wanna see the environmental effects of electric cars, just take a look at a strip mine for the lithium inside batteries. Yes, even “green” cars have environmental trade-offs. The only question now is how long before lefties turn against their beloved Priuses.This is why we think it’s insanity for lefties to think they can tax and regulate climate change out of existence. They don’t seem to ever question whether their ideas are actually better.
