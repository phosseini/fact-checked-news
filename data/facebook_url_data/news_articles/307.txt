Miley Cyrus and numerous other American celebrities threatened to move out of the country to avoid living under newly-elected President Trump. As the Mirror reports, other famous female faces who can’t stand the thought of a reality show star running the free world include Amy Schumer, Cher, and Lena Dunham.

Schumer said she would move to Spain if Trump won the presidency, while Cher proclaimed that she would move even farther away from America by catching a flight to Jupiter. Lena Dunham and Neve Campbell decided they would stay a little closer to Hollywood by heading to Canada, and Miley Cyrus didn’t specify where she would go. “We’re all just f**king jam between his rich a*s toes!” Cyrus wrote of Trump in a March 2 Instagram post. “Honestly f**k this s**t I am moving if this is my president! I don’t say things I don’t mean!).”

Miley Cyrus’ most recent Instagram post about Donald Trump — a screenshot of a Washington Post article about him getting booed at a polling station — has been flooded with thousands of celebratory comments from Trump supporters and internet trolls who want Miley to get out of America.

“I hope you are packed! do us a favor and don’t come back, please,” @udjlopez wrote. “You are a bad image to little girls, real talk. You might consider going to Saudi Arabia is a nice place to live and you might like it.”

“Go and move out! Puppet of the media!!” @peaksteam demanded.

“Now u need to get moving like you said you would u filthy skank,” @dannycats_mom wrote.

“If I say you would be missed that would make me a bigger liar than Hillary! Pack up your clown couture and get going!” @anniewolfe303 commented.

Miles wants NOTHING to do with Donald. She’s repeatedly made posts about how dangerous and offensive he is (even calling him a “f*cking nightmare”), but her hated for him reached it’s peak when she said she would “move out da country” if he won. Yikes!
