On Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the economy added 148,000 nonfarm jobs in December but only 139,000 when the revisions for October and November are included. A better way to understand how the job market is doing is to include the revisions and look at a multi-month average. This is especially important due to the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma since September only added 38,000 jobs.

Over the September to December timeframe there were 163,000 additional jobs per month and for the year 171,000 jobs were added monthly. This compares to President Obama’s last six years where the job market averaged at least 174,000 per month and hit 250,000 in 2014. It isn’t too surprising that job growth has slowed since the unemployment rate has dropped to very low levels.

President Trump’s goal is for 25 million more jobs over 10 years, and for last year 2.06 million jobs were added. Since the job market naturally grows by 1% to 2% a year the 25 million should be made without much help from policies such as tax reform. One impediment from hitting 25 million could be lower immigration especially since the unemployment rate is at 4.1% and the US’ population only provides 60,000 to 80,000 people entering the job market per month.

The unemployment rate remained 4.1%, which is the lowest since December 2000’s 3.9% when the GDP grew 4.1% during the tech bubble. The participation rate of 62.7% has been essentially flat over the past four years, which also means it will be hard to increase the number of jobs added by much more than 2 million per year.

Hourly earnings increased by 2.5% over the past year from $25.98 to $26.63 per hour. This compares to wage growth of 1.7% to 2.9% per year over the past nine years. Economists and employees have been waiting for wages to increase faster due to the low unemployment rate. 2018 may be the year they start to materialize but if they do it will probably be a long process. The tax cut may help to jump-start it.
