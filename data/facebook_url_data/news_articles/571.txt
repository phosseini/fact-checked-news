CHAMBERSBURG, Pennsylvania – Pop superstar Adam Levine has revealed in a new interview that he is moving to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. In the newly released interview, Levine said:

“I know it sounds kind of crazy but it’s something that I’ve been thinking about for a long time. I’ve visited Chambersburg, Pennsylvania a few times over the years and the people there have always seemed like the most genuine and sincere people I think I’ve ever met and most of them had no idea who I was which is kind of a great thing sometimes, to be honest. No place is perfect but Chambersburg just feels like home to me and it’ll be a nice change from what I’ve been used to.

Last time I was there I saw a sign at a motel that read, ‘No crack heads allowed’ and I said to myself, ‘Ya know what, I don’t want to live in a place with crack heads.’ I think it’s cool they discourage that type of thing around here,” Levine told the magazine.

Real estate brokers in the area were understandably excited about the news that the wealthy pop superstar was moving to their area and some unconfirmed reports are claiming that he already has a home picked out.
