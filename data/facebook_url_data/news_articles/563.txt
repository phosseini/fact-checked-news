The current owner of the property was redeveloping the house and had to dig up the foundations, so that’s when the mass grave was revealed, Cartwright said.

“The current occupier was excavating the southern end of the property when he came across some leg bones,” explained Cartwright. “He notified local law enforcement who then called in the FBI once they realized the extent of the number of victims.”

Authorities state that it is still very soon to know that much in the identification and recovery procedure, but they calculate the grave to be about 50 years old and hold about 10 bodies.

The FBI did not want to discuss on who they think is at fault or how the bodies were found there due to the investigation that was underway. Nevertheless, Mississippi records list Eldon Lee Edwards, a U.S. Ku Klux Klan leader, as the owner of the property from the years of 1945-1953.

In the year 1960, Eldon Lee Edwards died. In 1944, he was charged with being involved in the murder, torture and abduction of three black men, but he was never found guilty or convicted.
