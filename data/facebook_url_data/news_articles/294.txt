President Trump on Tuesday made the claim that a photo ID is required to buy groceries as part of his argument for introducing stricter voter ID laws.

"You know if you go out and you want to buy groceries, you need a picture on a card," he said. "You need ID."

President Trump, at his rally in Tampa, is pushing for voter ID laws and said you need to show an ID to buy groceries.

The president made the comment while speaking at a campaign rally in Florida in support of GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis's gubernatorial bid. It came as he was pushing for stronger voter ID laws, pointing to other instances where an American would need to show identification.

Social media users were quick to jump on Trump's comment, with many suggesting that Trump has not purchased his own groceries in many years.
