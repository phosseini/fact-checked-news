The Washington Examiner reported that Ripon College in Wisconsin has decided there can be no memorial to 911 on their campus this year because it might offend Muslims. The “Bias protocol board” ruled that this year there would be no flyers, no banners, no remembrance. Some are not happy about the ban on posters, and see it as an attempt to “sanitize” US History.

What’s the reasoning? “Students from a Muslim background would feel singled out and/or harassed.”

There’s that “feelings” word again. What about the families of the victims, did they have “feelings?” What about those  FDNY firefighters who had to witness the carnage? Did they have feelings? And Thos who have died since because of the toxicity of thesite as they had to crawl through jagged metal, extreme  dust to find more victims? Don’t their feelings count?

Remembering September 11, 2001 is as important as remembering Pearl Harbor on December 7. Innocent lives were taken. Thousands died. The only way to stop repeating history is to face it head on.

The argument that “radical Islam” is a “small part of the whole” is bunk. It exists. It kills innocent people. The sooner we stop playing to people’s feelings and start walking in truth the quicker we will see clearly past the lies we have been fed.
