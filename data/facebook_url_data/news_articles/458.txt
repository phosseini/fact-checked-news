President Uhuru Kenyatta has praised the Philippines President Hon. Rodrigo Duterte, who he claims to be the strongest man around the globe as at now.

“It should be remembered that Philippines was down economically before Duterte, today the Asian country is being admired by those who claimed to be super powers. It is without doubt Duterte’s work can be seen.” said President Uhuru Kenyatta

“They have been thinking they can colonize us, control us but Duterte has set a good example for other leaders to follow. We should not be intimidated by the so called super powers because our lands are rich. Actually, they need us more than we need them. The European and USA needs Duterte more than he needs them. Duterte is someone to emulate, he’s the strongest man on earth as we speak.” he added.

Kenyatta was speaking during annul East Africa summit, the president encouraged his counterparts to remain firm and resist any form of intimidation from the west. He gave an example where the Philippines President once declined aid from Europe, where he claimed that their aid was aimed at controlling Africa and Asian countries.

After a summit with the European Union (EU), President Rodrigo Duterte maintained the Philippines will refuse any aid from the regional bloc.

When asked if he talked to European Council President Donald Tusk about possible donations from the EU, which he had repeatedly rejected, Duterte only had harsh words.

“Forget it. We will survive, even if we have to eat dried fish and rice, we will survive,” Duterte said last year in a press conference after the country’s hosting of the 31st Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit and Related Summits.

“Just don’t f*** with my country about sovereignty. That is really an insult. I consider it as a very serious insult,” he added.
