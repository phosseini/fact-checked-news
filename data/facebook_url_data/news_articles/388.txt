The full panel of nine Supreme Court justices met to decide the fate of Islam taught in public schools. Under Obama’s lead schools were teaching that Islam is a peaceful religion, even though all of our real life examples contradict that.

Treddify reported that Judge Neil Gorsuch cast the tie-breaking vote. The 5-4 ruling was that the only part of Islam history taught in public schools will be Radical Islam and what students can do to help stop it.

Judge Gorsuch wrote, “The government certainly has no business being involved in religion, but this isn’t a government issue or a religious issue. This is about the judicial branch interpreting the laws as they apply to the teaching of religion. We should be
teaching any religions in this country besides standard Judeo-Christianity, as our founders wanted, and we certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day.”

Gorsuch continued, “It is our duty as Americans first and judges second to safeguard the way our children are indoctrinated.”

This is an additional ruling from the one just last week that forbids the teaching of Islamic tenets or Sharia as part of world history as well. The Obama administration obviously has no power or influence in the court anymore.

Our country and Christianity scored a huge win. Thanks to our president we can get back to respecting our true values and the normal every day worshipping of the only real God.
