LACKAWANNA, New York – Actor Matt Damon’s new interview is creating a lot of buzz in and around Lackawanna, New York this morning after the actor began praising Lackawanna residents for helping him when his car encountered some mechanical problems as he passed through the city recently:

“I was in Lackawanna, New York last week. I was actually just driving through and the car I was in started having some problems so I pulled over and was about to call the rental car company when I look up in my rear view mirror and see two cars pulling up behind me. These two guys get out and ask if I need any help. This is the kind of thing that would never happen in L.A., ya know?

So basically one of them has a cousin who owns a tow truck or whatever so they tow it in to get fixed and then they ask me if I want to get something to eat while I’m waiting on it and at this point I’m thinking, ‘Sure, what the hell’. I swear they had no clue who I was which just made it all even better.

We had a great lunch at this fantastic place off of – I think it was Ridge Road – and then they dropped me off at my car and I was on my way. Nicest people in the world. There just aren’t that many places like this anymore. I told them, ‘Someday I’m going to retire and I’m moving to Lackawanna, New York!'” Damon said with a laugh.
