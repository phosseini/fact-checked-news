Here’s MORE proof that Trump was right to blame “both sides” for the events in Charlottesville.

ZeroHedge discovered a Craigslist ad posted a week before the Charlottesville protests from a company called “Crowd Hire,” recruiting “actors and photographers” at $25 an hour.

This is now raising big questions over how these paid protesters were used as agitators in counter protests.

We’ve seen this same tactic used by the left for months, both before and after the election, to gather large crowds of paid protesters and agitators in order to riot and cause chaos.

Many of these paid protesters are directly funded by none other than George Soros.

Now, the discovery of a craigslist ad posted last Monday, almost a full week before the Charlottesville protests, is raising new questions over whether paid protesters were sourced by a Los Angeles based “public relations firm specializing in innovative events” to serve as agitators in counterprotests.

The ad was posted by a company called “Crowds on Demand” and offered $25 per hour to “actors and photographers” to participate in events in the “Charlotte, NC area.” While the ad didn’t explicitly define a role to be filled by its crowd of “actors and photographers” it did ask applicants to comment on whether they were “ok with participating in peaceful protests.”
