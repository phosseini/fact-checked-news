Just after dawn in the quiet Tracy Street neighborhood of Washington, DC, the FBI and NSA served a warrant at the Obama’s post-presidential rental mansion. The house, fortified with 10-foot walls and guard stations for Secret Service officers, serves as Obama’s residence in Washington and allegedly as the headquarters for the deep State Shadow government.

The warrant, which would have had to have been issued by a federal judge for federal agents to be involved, is for the search and seizure of any and all documents, hard drives or correspondence relating to national security not officially presented to the former president during his security briefings.

Essentially, the FBI and NSA are alleging that there are shady dealings going on inside the house that has been the center of controversy since Paul Ryan, John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Dr. Ben Carson were all seen entering the house for secret meetings, presumably to take down President Trump.

If secrets are being revealed to keep Obama in power as a player in Washington and the warrant roots them out, a lot of people are going to be in a lot of trouble.

This is a developing story that will be updated.
