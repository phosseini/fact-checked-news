MONROE, North Carolina – Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher was taking part in a radio interview this morning when he praised Monroe, North Carolina residents who had helped him when the rental car he was driving encountered mechanical problems while he was passing through the city recently:

“We were just leaving Monroe, North Carolina when our car began to overheat or something so I pulled over and was trying to find the rental car company’s number and I looked up in my rear view mirror and saw another car pulling up behind me. I was a little unsure of what was going on at first but as they got out of their car and started walking towards me I realized they were actually coming to help me – which kind of caught me off guard. This kind of thing doesn’t normally happen in L.A.,” Kutcher said with a laugh.

Kutcher continued, “So, after chatting for a bit, one of the guys says, ‘You’re welcome to join us for lunch instead of waiting on the side of the road.’ And I thought, ‘Sure, what the hell.’ So we drove to what is probably the finest restaurant in all of Monroe – some place called Oasis, I think it was – and I had one hell of a great sandwich there. About an hour later I was picked up and yeah… that’s my story about Monroe, North Carolina. It’s nice to know there are still places like this in the world.

They had no idea who I was either, which honestly, just made my day. These people in Monroe are the real deal. If I ever retire, I’m moving there!”
