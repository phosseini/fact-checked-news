Obama Tax Audit Turns Up MILLIONS In Offshore Accounts Stolen From Taxpayers.

Liberals are always on Donald Trump’s case about his tax returns. They don’t seem to get that our president doesn’t feel the need to rush to get his tax returns out because he has nothing to hide. Making them squirm and speculate is just fun. If I were Trump I’d release my tax returns promptly... on January 21st, 2025.

That’s not the case, however with former president Barry Soetoro. Using the alias he has denied is his many times, Obama was just nabbed with more than $400 million in taxpayer money sitting in accounts in the Cayman Islands, Ireland and Caledonia. The deposits, all made directly from the national treasury, are listed as “royalty payments” for Obamacare.

Few people know it, but when the liberal congress of 2010 passed the Obamacare bill without reading it, a percentage of the proceeds was automatically routed to the bill’s author, Barack Obama, to cover “expenses and royalties associated with naming the bill.” It wasn’t until the Affordable Care Act came out later that Obamacare was officially renamed and the royalties stopped, but not be3fore the Obama family pocketed $411 million. Of that, it appears that $400 million was transferred discreetly to accounts offshore to Barry Soetoro, LLC, a legal entity operating out of three foreign countries.

By transferring his money there, Obama has avoided paying more than $170 million in taxes that could have gone towards funding all of the free stuff he gave to the inner city folks so they’d re-elect him in 2012. Instead he ran up a deficit higher than any president in history and quadrupled our debt.

If Trump or any honest American companies and businessmen did what Obama did they’d be under federal investigation. Now that Obama isn’t in the White House and there’s nobody around to shield him, he can certainly be investigated and charged for these serious crimes.
