Multiple women have accused actor Morgan Freeman of harassment and inappropriate behavior, alleging he inappropriately touched them and made suggestive comments about their appearance, CNN reported Thursday.

The news outlet spoke with eight people who say they were harassed on production sets or on promotional tours and eight others who say they witnessed Freeman's alleged inappropriate behavior.

One woman told CNN that Freeman rubbed her lower back and tried lifting up her skirt while she was working on the movie set for “Going In Style.”

CNN reporter Chloe Melas, who co-authored Thursday’s exposé, alleged that Freeman made inappropriate comments to her about her pregnancy when she was covering the release of the film.

Melas said Freeman told her “I wish I was there” while cameras were recording. Melas said Freeman continued by telling her, "You are ripe." As is typical of press junkets, Melas was the only CNN reporter present at the time.

Other sources described instances where Freeman made inappropriate comments about women's appearances and stared at their bodies. They told CNN they did not file formal complaints out of fear of retaliation.

Freeman sent CNN a statement after the report was published.

"Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy," the actor said. "I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent."

Women in numerous industries have come forward to share allegations of sexual harassment following the rise of the "Me Too" movement. The movement began last year when members of the entertainment industry alleged widespread sexual harassment and assault by film mogul Harvey Weinstein.

In response to the movement, a group of women in the entertainment industry founded Time's Up, an initiative that aims to address systemic sexual harassment and provide legal resources for women who have been harassed.
