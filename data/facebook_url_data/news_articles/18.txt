TUSCALOOSA, Alabama – Reports out of Hollywood this morning are confirming that a portion of the next Star Wars movie will be filmed near Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The yet-to-be disclosed location near Tuscaloosa will represent an unknown, but pivotal, planet in the Star Wars universe.

Details have not yet released as to when production would occur in the Tuscaloosa area, but they stated it should begin no later than this fall. A casting call for extras will be announced well before then, though. Local fans of the series were understandably excited about the news and particularly excited about the prospect of becoming an extra in the film after producers made this short statement, released to the press earlier today: “We think Tuscaloosa is a great place to find the hundreds of extras needed to support our alien civilization and we’re very excited about filming there. It’s countryside is really a beautiful part of the world with diverse land-forms that open up a lot of possibilities for us.”
