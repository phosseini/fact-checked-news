The King of Swaziliand, King Mswati III has made a declaration in the country that starting from June 2019, men will be required to marry at least two or more wives, if not, they’ll face jail.

The king believes taking more wives will help women get husbands. Women are still regarded as sex objects meant only for procreation in many cultures and getting married is the ultimate for social acceptance.

The king, who has 15 wives and 25 children, while his father and predecessor has more than 70 wives and 150+ children, noted that there are more women than men in Swaziland which he says is a very serious problem for a country, which is known to be full of virgins.

According to IHarare, men from Swaziland are therefore required and expected to take more wives so that every woman gets a husband.

In a statement, King Mswati called for all men in the country to marry at least five wives and the government assured the men that it would pay for the marriage ceremonies and buy houses for them.

The country which is known to be full of virgins, is also said to have more women than men.

“Here’s the deal, marry at least five wives and you’re assured that the government will pay for the marriage ceremonies and buy houses for them” a palace source reveals.

King Mswati warned that any man or woman who opposes the decision “will face a life sentence”.

Polygamy has caused considerable amount of instability in many homes where it is being practiced. Strife, violence, rejection and poverty and depriving the young ones education have backgrounded its function of communal fraternity.
