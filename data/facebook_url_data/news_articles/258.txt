For some of us, cutting down on our intake of unhealthy things is often one of our foremost New Year’s resolutions. But recent research suggests that this might not be such a good idea if alcohol is your target.

That’s right: tequila might actually be able to help you lose weight. With the time for festive celebrations just around the corner, we at Bright Side are overjoyed to share this information with you.

According to a 2014 study, the natural sugars found in the agave plant — which is used to make tequila — have the ability to lower blood glucose levels, in turn helping obese people lose weight.

According to Mercedes G. López, one of the researchers who took part in the study, the elements that are contained in tequila help to increase levels of a hormone that slows down the rate at which the stomach becomes empty. This makes you feel fuller for longer.

In another study, scientists fed mice a standard diet and added natural sugars, called agavins, to some of their water. They discovered that the mice who consumed agavins ate less overall and had lower blood glucose levels.

Do agavins affect us differently compared to other sweeteners? López explained that unlike other sweeteners, such as high-fructose corn syrup, agavins can’t be digested by being broken down by the human body and, therefore, don’t raise blood glucose levels.

So next time someone points out that you’re still drinking tequila after New Year, tell them it’s part of your resolution to lose weight!
