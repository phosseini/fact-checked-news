Two federalized deputies working for Trey Gowdy were discovered tortured and killed recently while on their way to serve a search warrant on the Clinton Presidential library. The details of the crime are sketchy but one thing is certain: whoever pulled it off is a pro who left absolutely no evidence behind.

Mr. Gowdy, who has had little to nothing to say on the matter for security reasons, released a statement from his office where he is currently holed up under the protection of US Marshals:

The incident in Arkansas is just the latest in a vast conspiracy to cover up crimes by one of the most corrupt families in human history. No, we have no evidence. There’s never any evidence. What we do have, however, is a mole. Someone inside my own committee cost those men their lives by leaking their travel plans. I intend to find out who that mole is and have them waterboarded as an enemy of the state until they give up their boss.

Gowdy is clearly at the end of his rope. To insist on enhanced interrogation means he believes the perpetrator is an enemy combatant. That’s going to put a lot of pressure on the family in question to cover their tracks. Hopefully nobody else needs to go missing.
