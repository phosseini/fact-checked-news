he United States food and drug administration (FDA) is worried because it turns out that a whopping one million pounds of rat meat is being sold on the market.

The rat meat is sold in the form of boneless chicken wings and it is then served in restaurants on the entire territory of the USA.

There are reports that reveal that FDA agents are very concerned about the situation. This happened after a number of illegal shipping containers arrived from China. They were seized by the law enforcement agencies at the San Francisco port.

They contained rat meat that was supposed to be shipped to different companies. These companies would process it and then sell it as chicken meat.

There is a report that claims that the amount of meat that has been seized is so large, that they don’t know what to do with it, other than destroy it. The people from the FDA warn that there are around one million pounds of rat meat still being sold as chicken in the U.S.

Please, be careful and don’t buy suspicious chicken meat. Buy chicken from a secure seller or a person that you trust.
