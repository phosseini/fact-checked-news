After eight years of flying to Chicago for White Castle burgers, bringing Michelle Obama to LA for the afternoon for a hair appointment and taking the Obama girls to a park they like in San Fransisco to walk the dog on the government dime, the crew of the famed Air Force One has said enough is enough.

Obama was set to leave Hawaii tomorrow, just for the day, to meet with a pal 6000 miles away for a round of golf. The Captain of the President’s plane told him that unless it was official business from the office of the President, he wasn’t obligated to fly him anywhere.

Obama will fly out on the Air Force Osprey they use to transport the family dog, BO, who was forbidden from traveling on the President’s big plane after he peed on the leg of the French foreign minister during one of Michelle Obama’s lavish vacations. The Osprey, which costs less to fly than a 747, is still going to cost the American taxpayer $2 million for the day.
