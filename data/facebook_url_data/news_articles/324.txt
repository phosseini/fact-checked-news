The Condom Challenge is the latest dangerous teen trend that is hopefully not sweeping the nation. The challenge involves inhaling an unwrapped condom through your nose and pulling it through your throat.

Like many questionable young trends, the Condom Challenge isn’t new, but rather a resurgence of something bored teens have been doing for years. Typing the Condom Challenge into YouTube will leave you with an array of videos of young people snorting condoms up their nose.

The Condom Challenge was just one of many dangerous teen trends that parents were taught of in a new San Antonio class for parents who want to better understand what their kids are doing behind closed doors, KMPH reported.

"There are all kinds of drugs and kids are clever, so it's just really what are our kids doing? So, that's what we try to share," said Stephen Enriquez, a state education specialist, KMPH reported. According to Enriquez, social media and the need for “likes, views, and subscribers” is helping to drive the trends. "As graphic as it is, we have to show parents because teens are going online looking for challenges and recreating them."

Snorting a condom isn’t just painful, it’s dangerous, 12 News Arizona reported. The nose is the opening to the airwaves, and there’s always a risk that when you snort the condom it won’t just come out your mouth but may get inhaled in the lungs, DC Inno reported.

In one case, a 27 women accidentally inhaled a condom during oral sex and experienced a persistent cough and fever for six months before her doctors identified the source of her problems.
