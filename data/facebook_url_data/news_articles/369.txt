A 27-year old Huber Heights, Ohio man is dead after the Christmas tree in the house he had broken into fell on him while he was trying to steal the presents underneath it.

The family at the property, who have requested to not be identified, say they were woken in the early hours of this morning to sounds from their downstairs living area where their Christmas tree was standing.

“I heard a mighty crash and what sounded like a man screaming out in pain,” said the male homeowner. “I quickly rushed downstairs and it was a terrible sight. The tree had fallen over and a man was trapped underneath.”

The homeowner and his wife lifted the tree off the intruder but found that one of the branches had pierced his neck and he was bleeding profusely. They phoned for help, but the robber was pronounced dead at the scene. “The tree branch ruptured his carotid artery and he died within minutes,” said one paramedic.

Investigators allege that the man –  a 27 year old who has not been named as his next of kin are yet to be formally notified of his passing – was in the process of stealing the presents from under the tree when it fell.

“As tragic as the circumstances are, it will hopefully pose as a cautionary tale this Christmas to any criminals who seek to commit similar acts,” said one official.
