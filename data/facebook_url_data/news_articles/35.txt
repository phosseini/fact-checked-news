Rehana Fathima, the Kiss of Love activist, carried sanitary napkins and garbage from dustbins in the mandatory ‘irumudi kettu’, say media reports. Irumudi kettu is a part of a devotee’s paraphernalia which carries articles for puja and abhishekam inside the temple.

The government sponsored their trip with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan directly asking IG of police to escort the feminist. According to mediareports, she wanted to create a drama by undressing in Sabarimala. Her Facebook post is filled with dirt and anti-Hindu, anti-Ayyappa rants. She told her friends that she wanted to throw sanitary napkins at Ayyappa idol and told her friends to remain glued on to their TV sets.

All the three women who turned up today were non-Hindus and non-believers. The media also played mischief by hiding the identity of Kavitha by not naming her surname Koshy. Koshy is a Malayali SFI activist and staunch Christian.
