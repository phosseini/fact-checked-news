According to hip hop overload, Jayz and his team roc nation will donate/create a trust fund for nipsey hussle’s kids. It is only right that they helped because Nipsey signed a management deal with Roc. The trust fund will have Lauren London as the executive so she can use the money as she please which is what Roc Nation Reps told Hip Hop overload.

I’m so tired. This one hurts a lot. Nipsey has been a longtime supporter of the ANJ page and always showed love. Hussle embodied the Jigga blueprint. Self-determination, ownership, community, love, kindness, unconditional support, unity, charity. Plus he could rap damn good. This is a loss beyond words. I’m so sorry Nip. We love you. The Marathon will continue forever 🏁 #JAYZ #NipseyHussle

“There’s people like Jay-Z. He helped me when I was really, really, really down. Really, really, really down,” Wayne said onstage in his address to the crowd. “Jay don’t want me to tell nobody. That man helped me with my taxes. He’s a real friend, y’all.”

Wayne is not the only person that Jay z has helped. After Meek spent 5 months in prison for violating his probation he has been speaking out about the injustice in the system. Meek wanted to talk with the president of the United States but Jay z told him not to.

“I’m just reaching back the same way people supported me,” he said. “I know a lot of people were supporters of my music, but when it came to real life... people standing outside in the rain, protesting and actually being a part of helping me get back on these streets, I felt like I’m entitled to give back.” said Meek Mill on the breakfast club.
