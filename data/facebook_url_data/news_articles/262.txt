President Trump’s legal team submitted a request to the Supreme Court early this week that they expected to see an answer to sometime in 2018. They expected that answer to be a resounding “no.”

The court instead returned a unanimous decision that might prove Donald Trump to be the smartest man on the planet. WHOIP Director Jeff Derpinger explains:

“President Trump found a loophole in the Evolution Clause that allows the President to make decisions of national security concerning our borders. In a decision in 1826, Chief Justice Jonathon Lieberston noted that the decision to secure the borders of Texas after the Alamo came at great national expense but that the benefit outweighed the cost.

Lieberston said that any amount that didn’t cause the financial sector to immediately collapse was within reason where the safety of the sovereignity of our nation is concerned. Certainly a few hundred billion dollars isn’t gonna make or break us.”

The High Court mirrored the decision of Lieberston’s court and insisted that if the nation is in peril, the President has the executive authority to use discretionary funds to fix it. Bush exercised the same clause when he invaded Iraq. Obama used it to bail out the Auto Industry. Trump wants to use it to keep rapists and drug dealers and Syrian Refugees in Mexico where they belong.

Once the Attorney general has had the opportunity to log the decision, Trump can enforce it and start building.
