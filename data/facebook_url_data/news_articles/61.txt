Singer Jon Bon Jovi is claiming in a new interview that he is moving his family to the Torrington, Connecticut area.

“I just want a place to escape to sometimes and the Torrington area seems like a good choice for my family. I know it’s going to be a lot different than what I’ve been used to but I’m actually really looking forward to that and I’m just hoping that I can find some peace and serenity there.

I know some people from the Torrington area who are helping me pick out a place. We’re looking for something kind of small and away from everything but not too far outside of Torrington. I’ve visited the area in the past and just loved the people there. They’re like… regular people, ya know? They’re not fake and completely full of themselves,” Bon Jovi said with a laugh.

Bon Jovi is rumored to also be considering running for mayor.
