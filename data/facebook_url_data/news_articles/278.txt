Timber rattler bites motorcyclist on W. Hwy 46, Brown County, In.

Authorities in Brown County, Indiana are warning motorcyclists to wear knee boots while riding or walking in wooded areas.

A cyclist was bitten while riding near Brown County State park late Thursday. He was wearing protective gear. However, only tennis shoes, instead of leather boots. And blue jeans instead of chaps. He was bitten on the shin. "I seldom wear heavy leather in the Summer, because of high temperatures and humidity." The rider said, " I never dreamed a rattler would lunge out at me from the weeds along the highway!" When asked to comment, the timber rattler said, "If it had been a biker on a Harley, I probably would not have bothered to bite him, but I just happen to hate Kawasaki's."
