“The vote marks a stunning reversal from just six months ago, when the chamber — then under GOP control — voted to decry illegal immigrant voting,” The Washington Times reported. “The 228-197 vote came as part of a broader debate on Democrats’ major legislative priority this year, HR 1, the ‘For the People Act,’ which includes historic expansions of voter registration and access, as well as a major rewrite of campaign finance laws.”

Today I offered a motion to recommit #HR1 reaffirming that only US citizens should have the right to vote.

Dems rejected it.
