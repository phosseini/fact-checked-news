STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Teens are snorting condoms as part of a viral challenge that has made a comeback.

The "Snorting Condom Challenge" has teens placing unwrapped condoms up their nostrils and inhaling them until the condom comes out of their mouth. 

The challenge has been around for a while, but according to new reports, it has made a comeback on social media. If you type condom challenge into YouTube, several videos of young people snorting condoms will show up.

Videos date back to 2007 on YouTube, and in 2013, Savannah Strong became one of the first YouTube stars to go viral for doing the challenge.

Several videos have been removed by YouTube for containing "harmful or dangerous content."

The trend has proven to be dangerous, as snorting a condom up your nose poses both a choking hazard and risks of allergic reactions and infections, Forbes reported.

This isn't the only dangerous challenge teens are attempting, as the "Tide Pod Challenge" made headlines in January for putting laundry detergent pods in their mouth, or cooking them and then eating them.
