LEWISTON, Idaho – Legendary actor and director Clint Eastwood is claiming in a new interview that he is moving to the Lewiston, Idaho area. Eastwood said that it wasn’t a permanent move and that his new home in Lewiston would simply serve as a haven from his public life:

“I just want a place to escape to sometimes and the Lewiston, Idaho area seems like a good choice for me. I know it’s going to be a lot different than what I’ve been used to but I’m actually really looking forward to that and I’m just hoping that I can find some peace and serenity there.

I know some people from the Lewiston area who are helping me pick out a place. We’re looking for something kind of small and away from everything but not too far outside of Lewiston. I’ve visited the area in the past and just loved the people there. They’re like… regular people, ya know? They’re not fake and completely full of themselves,” Eastwood said with a laugh.

Eastwood is rumored to also be interested in purchasing the homes of all of his neighbors within a two mile radius of his new Lewiston area home and is even considering running for mayor.
