On Friday, Chicago police released a statement saying “two brothers” are being questioned about a reported attack on ‘Empire’ star Jussie Smollett. Detectives consider these brothers as “potential suspects” and have “probable cause” that they may have committed a crime.

According to the Chicago Tribune:

The statement, tweeted by police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, did not say what charges the brothers, both in their 20s, could face. On Thursday, police were describing them only as “persons of interest” and Guglielmi emphasized then that they were not suspects.

A law enforcement source told the Tribune the two men, who are black, were brought in for questioning Wednesday night from O’Hare International Airport.

Smollett originally claimed late last month that he was attacked by two white men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him while they wrapped a rope around his neck and yelled, “This is MAGA country!”

Sources close to the case have told multiple news outlets that detectives are investigating the possibility that Smollett “staged the incident” with the help of the aforementioned brothers, who happen to originate from Nigeria and work with the actor on ‘Empire.’
