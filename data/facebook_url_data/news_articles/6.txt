On Friday, Donald Trump had a reasonable suggestion for NFL owners: if a player makes the team look bad by disgracing the National Anthem, they should be fired immediately.

“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say get that son of a bitch off the field now. He’s fired!” the President told an enthusiastic crowd.

Well, directly after his speech,that’s what one NFL owner did. Cleveland Browns owner Jerry Haslam recently dealt with that issue when a group of players led by linebacker Franklin Lewis knelt during the National Anthem to make a silly political point.

“I felt powerless to fire them before,” Haslam said in a press release. “But now that I know my President is behind me, I will gladly fire every player who does this, starting with Lewis.”

Haslam says he fired Lewis because he was the ringleader of the activity and he expects other players to “fall in line” or they will lose their jobs too.

This is great news! It’s time for people to stand up to idiots who disrespect our flag and country because they want to make a point. If you or I did something so horrible while at work, wewould be fired so why shouldn’t they be?

It’s unclear if other NFL owners have the stones to follow suit, but Haslam is a true American hero.
