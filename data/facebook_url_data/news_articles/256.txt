LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas – In a radio interview this morning, Hollywood actor Matt Damon took a few moments to praise Little Rock, Arkansas residents after they had helped him when his rental car encountered some mechanical problems as he was passing through the city recently:

“We were just leaving Little Rock, Arkansas when our rental car began to overheat so I pulled over to the side of the road and was just about to call the car company when I noticed there were a couple of cars pulling up behind me. They got out and asked if I needed any help and I told them that I was just about to call the rental car company. Then one of them says that he has a brother who owns a tow truck and a few minutes later it was there and they towed it in to get fixed.

So now we’re talking and I’m telling them that I’m just passing through the area and they offer to take me in to get lunch while my car is getting fixed and I’m thinking, ‘Sure, what the hell.’ So we drove to what is probably the finest dining spot in all of Little Rock – some place called Dave’s, I think it was – and had one hell of a great burger.

And these guys had no idea who I was which, honestly, just made my day. I’m telling you, these people in Little Rock are the real deal. If I ever retire, I’m moving there!” Damon said with a laugh.

Damon added later, “You have to understand, this is something that would have never happened in L.A.! So yeah… that’s my story about Little Rock, Arkansas. It’s really good to know that there are still places like this in America.”
