IRMO, South Carolina – Pop superstar Miley Cyrus is reportedly claiming in a new interview that she is moving to the Irmo, South Carolina area. Cyrus said that it wasn’t a permanent move and that her new home in Irmo would simply serve as a haven from her public life:

“I just want a place to escape to sometimes and the Irmo, South Carolina area seems like a good choice for me. I know it’s going to be a lot different than what I’ve been used to but I’m actually really looking forward to that and I’m just hoping that I can find some peace and serenity there.

I know some people from the Irmo area who are helping me pick out a place. We’re looking for something kind of small and away from everything but not too far outside of Irmo. I’ve visited the area in the past and just loved the people there. They’re like... regular people, ya know? They’re not fake and completely full of themselves,” Cyrus said with a laugh.

Cyrus is rumored to also be interested in purchasing the homes of all of her neighbors within a two mile radius of her new Irmo area home and is even considering running for mayor.
